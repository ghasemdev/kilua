/**
 * HTML-based lazy column implementation.
 *
 * Use this composable to display large amounts of elements on screen.
 * Items are only loaded as they appear on screen.
 *
 * Elements are loaded from top to bottom, in the same order as they are declared in [block].
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Lazily display a large list of users, unreferencing each from its by `UserId` by calling `requestUser()`:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Composable
 * fun ShowUsers(users: List<UserId>) {
 *     LazyColumn {
 *         items(users) { userId ->
 *             var user by remember { mutableStateOf<User?>(null) }
 *
 *             LaunchedEffect(userId) {
 *                 user = requestUser(userId)
 *             }
 *
 *             user?.also { Show(it) }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
